## Project Overview

This project is a Pinterest-like web application built using React and Sanity. It allows users to create and display pins. Throughout the development of this project, I gained valuable experience and learned the following key skills and concepts:

1. **OAuth Integration:** I implemented OAuth to enable user authentication and registration using Google accounts. This provides a secure and user-friendly way for users to access the application.

2. **Content Management with Sanity:** I leveraged Sanity, a unified content platform, to efficiently manage the content of the application. This included storing and organizing data, making it easy to maintain and update the application's content.

3. **React Best Practices:** I followed React best practices, including:

   - Folder & File Structure: I structured the project's files and directories in a clean and organized manner, making it easy to navigate and maintain.
   - Hooks: I used React hooks to manage state and side effects in a clean and functional way, improving the overall code quality.
   - Refs: I utilized refs when necessary to interact with the DOM, ensuring a smooth user experience.

4. **Routing in React:** I implemented routing in the application, allowing users to navigate between different views seamlessly. This enhances the user experience and makes the application feel like a single-page application (SPA).
